Just as experiments are logged in laboratory notebooks, it is important to document the code you use for analysis. However, there are key problems that can arise during code development that make it difficult to document and track which code version was used to create each result. 

**Code can continously evolve and sometimes as you are making it better you can also risk breaking it.**
1. Experiment with new ideas such as adding new features to a script, but we don't want to risk breaking currently working code.

**You will likely share your code with others**  
2. Shared code can be improved upon by collaborators or others in the community, but we dont want to have multiple poeple eamiling you code improvements or else you will lose track and will have to manually incorporate the changes.
 
It would be nice to have some sort of version control system that allows you to play with your code, while still having the ***old*** working code intact and running. Or a place to recieve code suggestions and check it before incorporating it.

**GitHub is a popular platform that allows for version control and collaboration***

### What is GitHub?:

### GitHub is primarily a web platform, which hosts code repositories along with distributed version control. Today, almost every developer working on a group project or individually uses GitHub as an important tool due to its capability of making version control easier. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management for every project. It's a great place where you can store and share your code, manage projects and publish code. 
### There are three main features to the basic GitHub flow that make GitHub so widely used and powerful â€“ branching, pull request and merge. 

1) Branching allows you to create a new environment to test ideas and make changes.
2) Pull request allows you tell the other person about your changes and tell them. They can then review the changes, discuss it.
3) These changes can then be merged into the original repository.

### Create a username and password that is easy for you to type. For the rest of this exercise, you will need to be logged into GitHub.
### GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax. Here is a great tutorial/cheat sheet on the markdown syntax by [@thanpolas](https://github.com/thanpolas/Practice/blob/master/Markdown-Cheatsheet.md)
