Info regarding ordination plots (Unconstrained vs Constrained)

Check out pdf above first that very briefly goes over unconstrained vs contrained analysis. Just click on it. Then you can find examples of a CCA plot on the very bottom of [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pjtorres/Bioinformatics-BC/blob/master/Reliability_reproducibility/Torres%20et%20al%202018%20-%20Gut%20Microbial%20Diversity%20in%20Women%20with%20Polycystic%20Ovary%20Syndrome%20Correlates%20with%20Hyperandrogenism.ipynb) and [here](http://deneflab.github.io/MicrobeMiseq/demos/mothur_2_phyloseq.html) you can find a nice tutorial on CAP analysis.
